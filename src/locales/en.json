It is told that one can only find this hole by pure fate, or through a secret portal in a mysterious bar from RPF when one is feeling hopeless, confused, and exhausted. \n\nNo matter what species you belonged to before falling into this world, you always revert into a young rabbit once you land in Galaxy Frens. Although this is a carefree world absent of worries, you may notice that with each passing day here, you begin to lose more and more memories..."

By putting on our masks, we become Frens, and we’re are represented only by our Frens.\n\nWe may seem cute at a glance, but don’t let that fool you. We are “good friends” that take everything, including money, NFTs, music, and even your love, your tears, and your sense of loss. \n\nWe’d do everything we can to be rewarded some smiles, some adventure, some bounty, some…things that make us feel like we’re not just living a futile existence. We strive for more solace and encouragement. What I’m doing is for a brighter future, and honestly, who isn’t?"
